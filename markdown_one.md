## About Me
Hi, my name is **Destiny Ward**, and I am an Information Technology major, and currently enrolled as a dual enrolled BSIT/MBA student. Iâ€™m from the South Suburbs for Chicago, which is about six hours from Mizzou. I currently work as a Peer Learning Assistant at Mizzou.

## Academics
During my time at Mizzou, I have learned programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and C#. You can learn more information about each language below:

- [C#](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php)
